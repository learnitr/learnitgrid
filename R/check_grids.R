# At the point, all the evaluations must be filled. We check there is no missing
# scores and we calculate the final score for each student. The results are

#' This function checks all evaluation grids in a correction set and computes

#' @param dir The path to the evaluation grids

#' @param save.rds Should an RDS file with the data be saved (yes by default)?

#' @return A data frame with the results of the evaluation grids check for the
